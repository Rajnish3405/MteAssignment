Explain the sliding window technique and its applications in array problems.

Sliding Window:
It is a method of moving a window (subarray) over a larger array to solve problems like subarray sums, max/min elements, etc., in linear time.

Applications:
Maximum sum of subarray
Longest substring without repeats
Min/Max in subarray

Example:
Find max sum of subarray of size 3 in [1, 4, 2, 10, 2, 3] â†’ sliding window helps track the sum without recalculating every time.

Time Complexity: Usually O(n)
Space Complexity: Depends on problem (O(1) to O(n))
