Explain the concept of linked lists and their applications in algorithm design.

Linked List:
It is a linear data structure where each element (called node) points to the next. It is not stored in a continuous block like arrays.

Types:
Singly linked list
Doubly linked list
Circular linked list

Applications:
Efficient insertions/deletions
Used in queues, stacks, graphs, memory management

Example:
List: 1 → 2 → 3 → null

Time Complexity (for insertion/deletion): O(1) (if node is known)
Space Complexity: O(n)
