Explain the sliding window technique and its use in string problems.
Sol:-
Sliding window means using a window (like a frame) over the array or string, and moving it to solve problems in efficient time.
Uses in Strings:
Longest substring with conditions
Count characters in window
Pattern matching

Example:
In "abcabcbb", to find longest substring without repeat â†’ use a sliding window.

Time Complexity: Usually O(n)
Space Complexity: Depends on problem (can be O(1) to O(n))
