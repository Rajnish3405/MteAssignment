Explain the concept of equilibrium index and its applications in array problems.

Equilibrium Index:
It is an index where the sum of all elements before it is equal to the sum of elements after it.

Applications:
Load balancing
Divide array into equal parts
Array sum problems

Example:
Input: [1, 3, 5, 2, 2] â†’ Equilibrium at index 2 (1+3 = 2+2)

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
