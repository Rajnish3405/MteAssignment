Explain the concept of dynamic programming and its use in solving the maximum subarray problem.
Dynamic Programming (DP):
It solves problems by breaking them into smaller subproblems and storing results (memoization) to avoid repeating calculations.

In Maximum Subarray:
Kadaneâ€™s algorithm is a DP-based approach. It stores the best answer ending at each index and builds the solution as it goes.

Example:
Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
We store max subarray ending at each index using DP logic.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
