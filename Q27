Find the node where two singly linked lists intersect.

Algorithm:
Get lengths of both lists.
Move the longer list ahead by the difference in lengths.
Then move both together and check where they meet.

Code:-
public class IntersectionNode {
    public static ListNode getIntersection(ListNode headA, ListNode headB) {
        ListNode a = headA, b = headB;

        while (a != b) {
            a = (a == null) ? headB : a.next;
            b = (b == null) ? headA : b.next;
        }

        return a; // or b
    }
}

Example:
Lists: A = [1, 2, 8, 9], B = [4, 5, 8, 9] â†’ Intersection at 8

Time Complexity: O(n + m)
Space Complexity: O(1)
