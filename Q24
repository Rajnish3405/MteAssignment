Explain the concept of bit manipulation and its advantages in algorithm design.
Bit manipulation means using binary operations directly on numbers.
Operations like AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), NOT (~), LEFT SHIFT (<<), and RIGHT SHIFT (>>) help solve problems faster.

Advantages:
Very fast (bitwise operations are O(1))
Used in checking even/odd, power of 2, swapping, and more
Reduces memory usage

Example:
To check even/odd: (n & 1) â†’ 0 means even, 1 means odd

Time Complexity: O(1) per operation
Space Complexity: O(1)
